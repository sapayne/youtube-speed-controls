## YouTube Speed Controller

**YouTube Speed Controller is a Google Chrome Extension modified from [here](https://github.com/jamesdeklerk/youtube-speed-controls) to 
allow for controls similiar to the Youtube Playback Speed Control extension before it updated to work on all websites as there was no way of blocking from more sensitive sites like banking websites.**
